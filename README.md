**This project is not maintained.** I can't recommend a specific alternative, but have a look at [jQuery Mobile's `tap` event](https://api.jquerymobile.com/tap/), [Touche.js](https://github.com/benhowdle89/touche), [jquery.finger](https://github.com/ngryman/jquery.finger) and [jQuery-Touch-Events](https://github.com/benmajor/jQuery-Touch-Events).
